### `ddpg.py`: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

DDPG is a model-free, off-policy algorithm used for continuous action spaces. It combines elements of DQN and actor-critic methods. The actor network learns the optimal policy deterministically, while the critic network learns the Q-function. Experience replay and target networks are used to stabilize learning. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise is added for exploration.

#### Environments

*   **Pendulum-v0:** A classic control task where the goal is to swing up and balance a pendulum.
*   **LunarLanderContinuous-v2:** A continuous control environment where the goal is to land a lunar lander safely.
*   **MountainCarContinuous-v0:** A continuous control environment where the goal is to drive a car up a mountain.

### `dqn.py`: Deep Q-Network (DQN)

DQN is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. The algorithm utilizes experience replay to decorrelate training data and a target network to stabilize the learning process.

#### Environments

*   **CartPole-v0:** A classic control task where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
*   **GridWorld:** A grid-based environment with various rewards and penalties.
*   **LunarLander-v2:** A discrete action space environment where the goal is to land a lunar lander safely.

### `gan.py`: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

DCGAN is a generative model that uses convolutional neural networks for both the generator and discriminator. The generator network learns to generate realistic images from a latent vector, while the discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and generated images. The two networks are trained adversarially.

#### Datasets

*   **CelebA:** A large-scale face attributes dataset with rich annotations.

---

### `multiagent_ddpg.py`: Multi-Agent DDPG (MADDPG)

MADDPG is an extension of DDPG to multi-agent environments. It uses a centralized critic that has access to the observations and actions of all agents, but decentralized actors, where each agent learns its own policy based only on its own observations. This approach addresses the non-stationarity problem in multi-agent settings.

#### Environments

*   **simple\_tag:** A cooperative game where predator agents must tag a prey agent.
*   **simple\_spread:** A cooperative game where agents must cover different landmarks without colliding.
    *   These environments are part of the `multiagent-particle-envs` package.

### `policy_gradient.py`: Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)

A2C is a policy gradient method that combines an actor (policy) and a critic (value function) to improve learning stability and performance. The actor learns the optimal policy, while the critic estimates the value function.

#### Environments

*   **CartPole-v0:** A classic control task where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.

---

### `policy_value_iteration.py`: Policy Iteration & Value Iteration

These are classic dynamic programming algorithms used to find optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Policy iteration alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement, while value iteration iteratively updates the value function until it converges to the optimal value function.

#### Environments

*   **GridWorld:** A grid-based environment with various rewards and penalties.

---

### `qlearning_dynaq.py`: Q-learning & Dyna-Q

Q-learning is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm for discrete action spaces. Dyna-Q extends Q-learning by incorporating planning using a model of the environment. After each real experience, Dyna-Q updates its Q-value and also updates its model based on the transition. The agent then simulates `k` experiences by randomly selecting previously visited states and actions.

#### Environments

*   **GridWorld:** A grid-based environment with various rewards and penalties.

---

### `vae.py`: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

A VAE is a generative model that learns a probabilistic latent space representation of the data. It consists of an encoder network that maps the input data to a latent distribution (typically a Gaussian distribution) and a decoder network that maps samples from the latent distribution back to the original data space.

#### Datasets

*   **MNIST:** A dataset of handwritten digits.
